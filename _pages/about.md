I am a first year Computer Science PhD student at [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.cims.nyu.edu/), [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/), working with Prof. [Joseph Tassarotti](https://cs.nyu.edu/~jt4767/) in the [ACSys](https://cs.nyu.edu/acsys/) group.

My research interests lie broadly in formal verification, and I am currently working on crash-aware future-dependent linearizability verification using prophecy variables in [Iris](https://iris-project.org/).

In the summer and fall of 2023, I was an intern in Prof. [Xinyu Wang](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~xwangsd/)'s group at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), and worked on SMT-based automated bounded equivalence verification for SQL queries as a follow-up of the VeriEQL project.

I received my B.E. degree with honors from the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2024. During my undergraduate study, I worked with Prof. [Yu Zhang](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~yuzhang/) on foreign function interfaces of Go. My thesis is about Coq formalization of SQL query optimization rules, which is co-supervised by Prof. Yu Zhang and Prof. Xinyu Wang.
